# **Left Behind: Can Rural America Catch Up?**

## **Overview**
This project analyzes the socioeconomic challenges faced by rural America compared to urban areas. Using various datasets, we explore critical issues such as poverty, unemployment, migration, and education. The analysis provides data-driven insights into the structural disadvantages of rural America and proposes actionable strategies to foster economic growth and sustainability.

## **Introduction**
Rural America, once the cornerstone of American society, now faces significant economic and social challenges. Declining industries, low population growth, and limited access to education and healthcare have perpetuated cycles of poverty and stagnation. This project aims to:
- Understand the historical and current economic state of rural America.
- Highlight disparities between rural and urban areas.
- Propose solutions to revitalize rural economies and improve quality of life.

## **Report Specifications and Justifications**
The analysis uses data categorized into the following:
- **Income Data**: Examining poverty rates and per capita income to highlight economic disparities.
- **Jobs Data**: Tracking unemployment trends and sectoral employment rates.
- **Population Data**: Analyzing migration patterns and demographic changes.
- **County Classification**: Identifying counties based on economic typologies (e.g., farming, mining).
  
The variables chosen provide a comprehensive understanding of rural America’s challenges and allow comparisons with urban areas. These insights inform targeted interventions to improve rural economic performance.

## **Conclusion**
Rural America faces a self-perpetuating cycle of economic decline. However, data-driven strategies such as attracting the creative class, leveraging natural amenities, transitioning away from declining industries, and investing in education can create sustainable growth and resilience. Future research should explore case studies of successful rural economies and refine strategies for implementing these solutions.
