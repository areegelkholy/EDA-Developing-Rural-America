# **Left Behind: Can Rural America Catch Up?**

## **Overview**
This project analyzes the socioeconomic challenges faced by rural America compared to urban areas. Using various datasets, we explore critical issues such as poverty, unemployment, migration, and education. The analysis provides data-driven insights into the structural disadvantages of rural America and proposes actionable strategies to foster economic growth and sustainability.

## **Introduction**
Rural America, once the cornerstone of American society, now faces significant economic and social challenges. Declining industries, low population growth, and limited access to education and healthcare have perpetuated cycles of poverty and stagnation. This project aims to:
- Understand the historical and current economic state of rural America.
- Highlight disparities between rural and urban areas.
- Propose solutions to revitalize rural economies and improve quality of life.

## **Report Specifications and Justifications**
The analysis uses data categorized into the following:
- **Income Data**: Examining poverty rates and per capita income to highlight economic disparities.
- **Jobs Data**: Tracking unemployment trends and sectoral employment rates.
- **Population Data**: Analyzing migration patterns and demographic changes.
- **County Classification**: Identifying counties based on economic typologies (e.g., farming, mining).
  
The variables chosen provide a comprehensive understanding of rural America’s challenges and allow comparisons with urban areas. These insights inform targeted interventions to improve rural economic performance.

## **Analysis**
Key findings include:
1. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Positive correlation between poverty rates and unemployment.
   - Negative correlation between unemployment and GDP per capita.

2. **Demographic Trends**:
   - Rural areas show aging populations and significant population decline, contributing to labor shortages and limited economic growth.

3. **Educational Attainment**:
   - Urban areas have higher levels of college graduates, whereas rural areas lag behind with more residents having only a high school diploma or less.

4. **Industry Trends**:
   - Rural economies are over-reliant on declining industries (e.g., mining, manufacturing).
   - High-performing counties diversify into sectors like agriculture and services.

5. **Visualizations**:
   - Heatmaps, time-series graphs, and box plots illustrate disparities in education, population, and sectoral employment between rural and urban areas.

## **Proposed Solutions**
1. **Attracting the Creative Class**:
   - Focus on attracting professionals in creative fields (e.g., architects, engineers, artists) to boost innovation and economic growth.
   - Encouraging local entrepreneurship to create job opportunities.

2. **Leveraging Natural Amenities**:
   - Counties with high natural amenities (e.g., warm climates, scenic landscapes) should promote tourism and recreational activities to attract investment and talent.

3. **Shifting from Declining Industries**:
   - Reduce reliance on mining and traditional manufacturing, focusing instead on knowledge-intensive industries, advanced agriculture, and services.

4. **Investing in Education**:
   - Expand access to higher education and technical training to improve workforce quality and retain local talent.

---

## **Conclusion**
Rural America faces a self-perpetuating cycle of economic decline. However, data-driven strategies such as attracting the creative class, leveraging natural amenities, transitioning away from declining industries, and investing in education can create sustainable growth and resilience. Future research should explore case studies of successful rural economies and refine strategies for implementing these solutions.
